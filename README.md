## Prerequisites

For building and running the app, you first need to build the LOLCODE interpreter:

1. get the [LOLCODE interpreter](https://github.com/justinmeza/lci) lci by Justin Meza.
2. install C/C++ compiler if not yet on your machine.
3. install [CMake](https://cmake.org) for building the lci interpreter.

See Meza's instructions on how to build lci using CMake.

## Running 

After building and installing lci, you can run hello.lol using lci:

```
lci hello.lol
```
Enter your name and the app prints out a greeting. Then the app exits.  Try also giving an empty name.
